# tank-game-bots
Example of how to make bots for the tank-game project
This is intended to be used in conjunction with my other project. Which is in my tank-game repo. When this project is run, bots connect
to the tank game server.

## Installing and Running
```javascript
npm install

//You can set PORT, HOSTNAME, and BOT_COUNT as environment variables
npm start
```
